This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java array iteration. The `BuggyArray.java` file contains code that causes an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The `FixedArray.java` file provides a corrected version. This type of error is easy to miss during code review and can lead to unexpected program behavior or crashes. Careful attention to loop conditions and array bounds is crucial for writing robust Java code.
